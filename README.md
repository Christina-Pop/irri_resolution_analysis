These are the scripts for the analysis of the spaper Pop et. al "The role
of horizontal resolution in modeling irrigation effects with a coupled 
regional climate model system up to convection-permitting scale", which was 
re-submitted after major revisons to JGR Atmospheres.

Before running the scripts, please make sure to create the correct conda environment 
with irri_res_env.yml. In case of any problems, please reach ou to the author.

The data for the scripts is available under  
Pop, C. (2025). Data supporting "The role of horizontal resolution in 
modeling irrigation effects with a coupled regional climate model system
up to convection-permitting scale" (v1.0) [Data set].
